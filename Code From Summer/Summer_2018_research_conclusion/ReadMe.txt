Position angles found for these galaxies using the fit_kinematic_pa routine described in Appendix C of Krajnovic et al. 2006

PLATE - Plates of 262 galaxies in sample
IFU - IFU numebr of the galaxies
PA_GAS - Position angle of the corresponding galaxy found using the Halpha velocity map
PA_GAS_ERR - Error of PA_GAS as given by the fit_kinematic_pa routine
PA_STELLAR - Position angle of the corresponding galaxy found using the stellar velocity map
PA_STELLAR_ERR - Error of PA_STELLAR as given by the fit_kinematic_pa routine
DELTA_PA - Absolute value of (PA_STELLAR - PA_GAS). Note: all values that would have been over 180 were subtracted frim 360
MASS_ELL_PETRO - taken from the MPL-6 master catalogue (provided by Francesco Belfiore, this was alsowere we got the sample of galaxies from)
LOW_MASS_ALIGNED - True/False array for galaxies that are categorzied as low mass and aligned. Note: Low mass is defined as galaxies whose mass is less than the median mass of the sample
HIGH_MASS_ALIGNED - True/False array for galaxies that are categorzied as high mass and aligned.
LOW_MASS_MISALIGNED - True/False array for galaxies that are categorzied as low mass and misaligned.
HIGH_MASS_MISALIGNED - True/False array for galaxies that are categorzied as high mass and misaligned.
